## 2025-09-23 - Task Management System Debugging & Fixes

### Accomplishments
- ✅ Identified and resolved "failed to create task" frontend errors
- ✅ Fixed JSON circular reference issues causing 500 errors in task retrieval
- ✅ Resolved HTTP method mismatches between frontend and backend
- ✅ Implemented proper task dismissal functionality (POST → PATCH fix)
- ✅ Created dedicated task status update endpoint for simpler operations
- ✅ Fixed task acceptance workflow with new `/tasks/{id}/status` endpoint
- ✅ Resolved task completion issues with `CompleteTaskRequest` DTO creation
- ✅ Established reliable terminal workflow for service debugging
- ✅ Verified end-to-end task management system functionality

### Issues Resolved
1. **Task Creation Failures**: Frontend was sending raw objects, backend expected specific DTO structure
   - Solution: Enhanced `CreateTaskRequest` DTO usage and validation

2. **Task Retrieval 500 Errors**: EF Core navigation properties caused JSON serialization loops
   - Solution: Added `[JsonIgnore]` attributes to `User` and `SourceAlert` properties in `UserTask.cs`

3. **Task Dismissal Failed**: HTTP method mismatch (POST frontend vs PATCH backend)
   - Solution: Updated `taskService.dismiss()` to use PATCH method in `api.ts`

4. **Task Acceptance Failed**: Frontend sent partial `{ status }` object, backend expected full `UserTask`
   - Solution: Created new `[HttpPatch("{id}/status")]` endpoint and `taskService.updateStatus()` method

5. **Task Completion Failed**: Backend expected `string` parameter, frontend sent `CompleteTaskRequest` object
   - Solution: Created `CompleteTaskRequest` class and updated controller method signature

### Technical Implementation Details
- **New API Endpoints**:
  - `PATCH /api/tasks/{id}/status` - Simple status updates
  - Enhanced `PATCH /api/tasks/{id}/complete` - Accepts CompleteTaskRequest object

- **Enhanced DTOs**:
  - `CompleteTaskRequest` class in `Models/CreateTaskRequest.cs`
  - Improved `CreateTaskRequest` validation and error handling

- **Frontend Service Layer Updates**:
  - Added `taskService.updateStatus()` method
  - Fixed HTTP method consistency (PATCH for all update operations)
  - Enhanced error handling in `TaskDashboard.tsx`

- **Database Model Improvements**:
  - `[JsonIgnore]` attributes prevent serialization circular references
  - Proper timestamp handling for completion/dismissal operations

### Service Management Critical Note
⚠️ **SERVICE RESTART REQUIRED**: Any changes to controller method signatures, DTO classes, or model attributes require full backend service restart to take effect. Always restart services when making these types of changes.

### Testing Results
All task management operations now working:
- ✅ Create Task: Status 200, returns taskId
- ✅ Accept Task: Status 200, updates to Accepted status
- ✅ Dismiss Task: Status 200, updates to Dismissed status with timestamp
- ✅ Complete Task: Status 200, updates to Completed with optional notes and 100% progress
- ✅ Retrieve Tasks: Status 200, returns clean JSON without circular references

### Debugging Workflow Established
1. Use external service terminal windows (avoid VS Code terminal targeting)
2. Monitor backend logs in real-time during frontend operations
3. Test API endpoints directly with PowerShell before frontend testing
4. Always restart services after model/controller changes
5. Verify JSON responses for circular reference issues

### Next Steps
- Continue Phase 3 feature testing and validation
- Begin Phase 4 AI integration planning
- Consider implementing query splitting for EF Core performance warnings
