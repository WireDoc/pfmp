## 2025-09-23 - Task Management System Debugging & Fixes

### Accomplishments
- âœ… Identified and resolved "failed to create task" frontend errors
- âœ… Fixed JSON circular reference issues causing 500 errors in task retrieval
- âœ… Resolved HTTP method mismatches between frontend and backend
- âœ… Implemented proper task dismissal functionality (POST â†’ PATCH fix)
- âœ… Created dedicated task status update endpoint for simpler operations
- âœ… Fixed task acceptance workflow with new `/tasks/{id}/status` endpoint
- âœ… Resolved task completion issues with `CompleteTaskRequest` DTO creation
- âœ… Established reliable terminal workflow for service debugging
- âœ… Verified end-to-end task management system functionality

### Issues Resolved
1. **Task Creation Failures**: Frontend was sending raw objects, backend expected specific DTO structure
   - Solution: Enhanced `CreateTaskRequest` DTO usage and validation

2. **Task Retrieval 500 Errors**: EF Core navigation properties caused JSON serialization loops
   - Solution: Added `[JsonIgnore]` attributes to `User` and `SourceAlert` properties in `UserTask.cs`

3. **Task Dismissal Failed**: HTTP method mismatch (POST frontend vs PATCH backend)
   - Solution: Updated `taskService.dismiss()` to use PATCH method in `api.ts`

4. **Task Acceptance Failed**: Frontend sent partial `{ status }` object, backend expected full `UserTask`
   - Solution: Created new `[HttpPatch("{id}/status")]` endpoint and `taskService.updateStatus()` method

5. **Task Completion Failed**: Backend expected `string` parameter, frontend sent `CompleteTaskRequest` object
   - Solution: Created `CompleteTaskRequest` class and updated controller method signature

### Technical Implementation Details
- **New API Endpoints**:
  - `PATCH /api/tasks/{id}/status` - Simple status updates
  - Enhanced `PATCH /api/tasks/{id}/complete` - Accepts CompleteTaskRequest object

- **Enhanced DTOs**:
  - `CompleteTaskRequest` class in `Models/CreateTaskRequest.cs`
  - Improved `CreateTaskRequest` validation and error handling

- **Frontend Service Layer Updates**:
  - Added `taskService.updateStatus()` method
  - Fixed HTTP method consistency (PATCH for all update operations)
  - Enhanced error handling in `TaskDashboard.tsx`

- **Database Model Improvements**:
  - `[JsonIgnore]` attributes prevent serialization circular references
  - Proper timestamp handling for completion/dismissal operations

### Service Management Critical Note
âš ï¸ **SERVICE RESTART REQUIRED**: Any changes to controller method signatures, DTO classes, or model attributes require full backend service restart to take effect. Always restart services when making these types of changes.

### Testing Results
All task management operations now working:
- âœ… Create Task: Status 200, returns taskId
- âœ… Accept Task: Status 200, updates to Accepted status
- âœ… Dismiss Task: Status 200, updates to Dismissed status with timestamp
- âœ… Complete Task: Status 200, updates to Completed with optional notes and 100% progress
- âœ… Retrieve Tasks: Status 200, returns clean JSON without circular references

### Debugging Workflow Established
1. Use external service terminal windows (avoid VS Code terminal targeting)
2. Monitor backend logs in real-time during frontend operations
3. Test API endpoints directly with PowerShell before frontend testing
4. Always restart services after model/controller changes
5. Verify JSON responses for circular reference issues

### Next Steps
- Continue Phase 3 feature testing and validation
- Begin Phase 4 AI integration planning
- Consider implementing query splitting for EF Core performance warnings

## 2025-09-27 - Rebuild Wave Initiation & Component Recovery Plan

### Context / Why This Session Matters
After stabilizing TypeScript builds, refactoring authentication (removing `@azure/msal-react` in favor of direct `@azure/msal-browser` usage), and validating a minimal runtime shell, we discovered that a large set of previously implemented advanced frontend orchestration components (onboarding flow, protected routing shell, intelligence dashboards, alerts UI, setup context) were no longer present. Core leaf feature components (e.g., `SmartInvestmentRecommendations`, `RealBankAccountDashboard`, `ProtectedDashboardSections`) still exist, but the higher-order wiring, routing, and multi-step setup logic were missing. This session formalizes the recovery and forward strategy before recreating code to preserve historical traceability.

### Incident Summary
- Observed a minimal dashboard rendering without expected onboarding & intelligence layers.
- Repository searches confirmed absence of multiple orchestration & UI shell components referenced in legacy backup (`App-Complex.tsx.backup`).
- Determined safer to document & rebuild deliberately rather than attempt speculative resurrection of potentially divergent historical code.

### Gap Analysis (Frontend)
| Category | Still Present | Missing / To Recreate |
|----------|---------------|------------------------|
| Auth Core | AuthProvider (custom), dev bypass | AuthHeader, SignInPrompt, AuthDebugPanel |
| Routing & Guards | (Basic App shell only) | ProtectedRoute, Nested layout shell |
| Onboarding / Setup | (none) | UserSetupContext, WelcomeOnboardingFlow, SetupProgressTracker |
| Intelligence Dashboards | SmartInvestmentRecommendations (leaf), RealBankAccountDashboard | MarketIntelligencePanel, LiveMarketDashboard, FinancialIntelligenceCenter |
| Alerts & Tasks | Backend alert/task endpoints intact | SmartAlertsSystem (UI), alert â†’ task conversion UI layer |
| Debug / Dev Tools | (basic console logs) | DebugComponent (state inspector) |
| AI Pipelines | Placeholder investment rec component | Dual-AI (Recommend + Verify) abstraction layer |

### Confirmed Existing Artifacts to Integrate (Do NOT delete)
- `SmartInvestmentRecommendations.tsx`
- `RealBankAccountDashboard.tsx`
- `ProtectedDashboardSections.tsx`
- Backend controllers & models for Users, Accounts, Goals, IncomeSources, Alerts, Tasks

### Strategic Pivot
Move from ad hoc incremental UI additions to a structured "Rebuild Wave" approach. This ensures each layer (routing, context, onboarding, intelligence, AI orchestration) is reconstructed with clear acceptance criteria and testability before layering complexity.

### Rebuild Waves Plan (High-Level)
1. Wave 0: Documentation Alignment (CURRENT) â€“ Update README, log (this entry), add `REBUILD-WAVE-PLAN.md`, annotate migration status.
2. Wave 1: Foundation â€“ React Router v6+ integration, ProtectedRoute, layout shell, navigation skeleton, feature flag scaffolding.
3. Wave 2: User Setup & State â€“ `UserSetupContext`, onboarding wizard (demographics, risk, TSP, income), progress tracker, resumable steps, persistence hooks to backend.
4. Wave 3: Auth & Profile UX â€“ AuthHeader, SignInPrompt (dev bypass aware), UserProfileCard, Debug panels (AuthDebugPanel + general DebugComponent).
5. Wave 4: Intelligence & Dashboards â€“ Market dashboards (live & historical placeholders), FinancialIntelligenceCenter aggregation hub, SmartAlertsSystem UI tying alerts â†” tasks.
6. Wave 5: Dual-AI Pipeline Scaffold â€“ Abstraction: `PrimaryAdvisor (GPT-X placeholder)` + `ValidationAdvisor (Claude)` with consensus strategy + pluggable policy checks; integrate with recommendations + alerts.
7. Wave 6 (Progressive Enhancement) â€“ Performance pass (code splitting validation, suspense boundaries), accessibility & UX refinements, test harness expansion.

### Key Decisions This Session
- Treat missing components as intentional rebuild targetsâ€”not silent regressions to patch blindly.
- Preserve existing leaf components to avoid re-writing validated financial logic prematurely.
- Introduce dual-AI abstraction early (Wave 5) but mock underlying model calls until credentials & cost controls formalized.
- Maintain dev auth bypass until onboarding wizard stable (reduces friction during reconstruction).

### Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Scope Creep in Rebuild | Delayed functional recovery | Strict wave acceptance criteria & freeze once a wave starts |
| Reintroducing Tech Debt | Hidden complexity returns | Code review checklist per wave (routing clarity, context isolation, test hooks) |
| AI Cost Escalation Later | Budget overruns | Early mock interfaces & cost guard design in Wave 5 |
| User State Fragmentation | Inconsistent onboarding progress | Central `UserSetupContext` with backend sync + idempotent steps |
| Over-optimizing Performance Too Soon | Slowed feature delivery | Defer perf wave until after functional parity (Wave 6) |

### Immediate Accomplishments
- Cataloged existing vs missing orchestration components.
- Defined multi-wave rebuild roadmap with sequencing rationale.
- Logged strategic pivot & rationale prior to any recreations (audit trail maintained).
- Added documentation tasks to internal TODO system (foundation for Wave 0 completion).

### Outstanding Documentation Tasks (Wave 0)
- Update README with: current minimal state, rebuild rationale, dual-AI vision snapshot.
- Append `pfmp.txt` with "Rebuild Interlude" section summarizing pivot.
- Create `REBUILD-WAVE-PLAN.md` with detailed acceptance criteria per wave.
- Annotate `MIGRATION_STATUS.md` with note: frontend entering rebuild; backend phases unaffected.

### Next Engineering Actions
1. Finalize README rewrite (vision + current state disclosure).
2. Add `REBUILD-WAVE-PLAN.md` (detailed scope & DONE definitions per wave).
3. Update `pfmp.txt` (insert interlude + adjust phase numbering for resumed feature build).
4. Commit documentation (single commit: "docs: rebuild wave plan & component recovery log").
5. Begin Wave 1 implementation branch scaffolding (router + guard + layout shell).

### Acceptance Criteria for Closing Wave 0
- All docs updated & committed (README, log, rebuild plan, pfmp.txt, migration note).
- Clear published wave sequence & goals.
- No ambiguity about which components are intentionally missing vs pending.

### Meta / Traceability
This entry ensures that future diffs showing large component additions are contextualized as planned reconstruction rather than unexplained scope creep. Serves as canonical reference for when the platform transitioned from stabilization mode back into feature build-out.

### Status
Wave 0 IN PROGRESS â€“ Log entry complete; proceeding to README & supporting document updates.

---

## 2025-10-02 - Wave 0 Completion (Documentation Alignment)

### Accomplishments
- Closed Wave 0 per rebuild plan; formal completion doc at `docs/waves/WAVE-0-COMPLETION.md`
- README & BUILD.md updated (experimental Docker note, OpenAPI generation scaffold)
- First OpenAPI types generation committed (typed contract baseline)
- Provenance lifecycle (Advice accept/dismiss, auto task creation) fully documented & validated
- Backup discipline (pre-migration requirement + script) enforced in docs

### Key Artifacts
- `docs/waves/WAVE-0-COMPLETION.md`
- `docs/waves/REBUILD-WAVE-PLAN.md`
- `pfmp-frontend/src/api/generated/openapi-types.ts`

### Decisions
- Adopt per-wave semantic prerelease version bumps (advancing to v0.7.0-alpha)
- Defer Docker hardening (mapped drive issue) until after routing restored
- Implement feature flags + typed API client at Wave 1 start (foundational)

### Risks Forward
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Missing routing/layout (blocks onboarding) | Execute Wave 1 immediately |
| Lack of feature flags may couple experimental features | Add scaffold early in Wave 1 |
| Manual API calls could drift from OpenAPI spec | Replace with typed adapter now |

### Next Steps
1. Wave 1 routing skeleton (router, layout, ProtectedRoute)
2. Feature flag infra & usage pattern
3. Typed API client abstraction (inference helpers)
4. Storybook and visual regression planning docs

### Closure Signal
All Wave 0 acceptance criteria satisfied; wave formally CLOSED.
