# PFMP Documentation Archive

Historical materials and superseded notes live here. Files are grouped by category (for example, `notes/` for completion logs, `plans/` for old roadmaps). Nothing under this folder is considered active; reference only when researching past decisions.

## Conventions
- New archives should mirror original filename and include the original completion date in either the filename or the front matter.
- Leave a brief pointer in the source location (audit log or index) when relocating files so contributors understand where artifacts moved.
- Do not edit archived content except to fix broken links or redact sensitive data; add an addendum if context is required.
