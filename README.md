## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- .NET 9 SDK
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 15
- Git

### PowerShell Development Guidelines
**Important**: When working with PowerShell, follow these guidelines to avoid terminal conflicts:

#### .NET Commands
- Always use fully qualified paths with `dotnet` commands in PowerShell
- Example: `dotnet run --project W:\pfmp\PFMP-API\PFMP-API.csproj --launch-profile http`

#### Running API Server in Isolated Terminal
To avoid terminal conflicts, start the API server in a separate PowerShell window:
```powershell
Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList "-NoExit", "-Command", "cd W:\pfmp\PFMP-API; dotnet run --launch-profile http" -WindowStyle Normal
```

**Important**: Before starting a new server instance:
- Manually close any existing PowerShell windows running the API server, OR
- Stop the process: `Get-Process -Name "PFMP-API" | Stop-Process -Force`

#### Running React Frontend in Isolated Terminal
```powershell
Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList "-NoExit", "-Command", "cd W:\pfmp\pfmp-frontend; npm run dev" -WindowStyle Normal
```

#### Service Management Best Practices
- Use isolated terminal windows to prevent targeting conflicts
- Always terminate existing services before starting new instances
- Monitor both frontend (port 3000) and API (port 5052) during development
- Use the batch file for reliable service startup
- **CRITICAL**: Restart backend service after any controller/model/DTO changes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Service Restart Requirements
The following changes require a **complete backend service restart** to take effect:
- Controller method signature changes
- New DTO classes or model classes
- Entity Framework model changes (adding `[JsonIgnore]`, navigation properties)
- Program.cs configuration changes
- New API endpoints or route changes

**Always restart services using your batch file when making these types of changes!**

### Development Workflow
1. **Before rebuilding**: Always stop running services to avoid file locks
2. **Process termination**: Either close terminal windows manually or use PowerShell to stop processes
3. **Build verification**: Run `dotnet build` to confirm no file locks before starting services
4. **Migration workflow**: Stop services ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Apply migrations ‚Üí Restart services

This command:
- Opens a new PowerShell window (`Start-Process powershell`)
- Keeps the window open after execution (`-NoExit`)
- Changes to the API directory and runs the server
- Uses normal window style for easy monitoring

### Backend Setup (.NET API)
```bash
cd PFMP-API
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run --launch-profile http
```
API will be available at: http://localhost:5052

### Database Setup
PostgreSQL database is running on Synology NAS:
- Host: 192.168.1.108:5433
- Database: pfmp_dev
- User: pfmp_user

### Frontend Setup (‚úÖ Complete)
```bash
cd pfmp-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
React development server runs on: http://localhost:3000  
API proxy configured for `/api` requests ‚Üí http://localhost:5052

### End-to-End Testing
The complete stack has been tested and verified:
- ‚úÖ Frontend (React) ‚Üî API (ASP.NET Core) ‚Üî Database (PostgreSQL)
- ‚úÖ User CRUD operations working through all layers
- ‚úÖ Proxy configuration routing requests correctly
- ‚úÖ Database migrations applied successfully

### Testing Guidelines

**Authentication Bypass**: All test users have `BypassAuthentication = true` - no login required during development.

**API Testing Examples**:
```bash
# Get young employee recommendations
GET /api/tasks/ai/recommendations?userId=1

# Get mid-career portfolio analysis  
GET /api/tasks/ai/portfolio-analysis?userId=2

# Get military member alerts
GET /api/alerts?userId=3&isActive=true

# Test setup wizard with incomplete user
GET /api/profile/setup/progress?userId=4
```

**Production Transition**: Set `Development:BypassAuthentication: false` in configuration to enable real authentication. Test accounts will be filtered out by `IsTestAccount = true`.
