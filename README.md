# PFMP - Personal Financial Management Platform

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **REBUILD NOTICE (Wave 0 ‚Äì Documentation Alignment)**  
> Frontend orchestration layers (routing shell, onboarding wizard, protected layout, intelligence dashboards, alert UI) are currently being **reconstructed** after discovering higher-order components were missing. Backend APIs, data models, and several advanced leaf components (e.g., `SmartInvestmentRecommendations`, `RealBankAccountDashboard`) remain intact. This README now reflects the *current minimal runtime* plus the structured rebuild plan.

An AI-powered financial advisor platform designed for government employees and military members, providing personalized investment recommendations, portfolio management, and retirement planning with specialized TSP and government benefit integration.

## üß™ Testing Documentation
Core manual testing flows live under `docs/testing/`:
- `docs/testing/alerts-advice-testing.md` ‚Äì CURRENT simplified lifecycle (Alert ‚Üí Advice:Proposed ‚Üí Accept (creates Task) OR Dismiss)
- `docs/testing/advice-testing.md` ‚Äì Legacy (Deprecated) lifecycle reference (Retained for historical context only)
- `docs/testing/tasks-testing.md` ‚Äì Task CRUD, status workflow, provenance verification
- `docs/testing/README.md` ‚Äì Index & conventions

Current Advice Lifecycle (Simplified):
```
Alert --[generate-advice]--> Advice (Proposed) --[accept]--> Advice (Accepted, task auto-created)
                                             \--[dismiss]--> Advice (Dismissed)
```
Legacy endpoints `/reject` & `/convert-to-task` now return 410 Gone.

Validator / Provenance:
- Acceptance creates a Task if none exists and backfills `SourceAdviceId` + `SourceType="Advice"`.
- `acceptedAt`, `dismissedAt`, `previousStatus`, `sourceAlertId`, `generationMethod`, and optional `sourceAlertSnapshot` enrich auditability.

Quick Start (User 1):
```powershell
# Generate generic portfolio advice
Invoke-RestMethod -Method POST http://localhost:5052/api/Advice/generate/1 | Select-Object adviceId,status

# Generate advice from alert 1
Invoke-RestMethod -Method POST http://localhost:5052/api/Alerts/1/generate-advice | Select-Object adviceId,sourceAlertId,status

# Accept advice (replace 123 with real id) ‚Äì creates linked task automatically
Invoke-RestMethod -Method POST http://localhost:5052/api/Advice/123/accept | Select-Object adviceId,status,linkedTaskId

# Dismiss another proposed advice
Invoke-RestMethod -Method POST http://localhost:5052/api/Advice/124/dismiss | Select-Object adviceId,status

# List all advice (user 1)
Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:5052/api/Advice/user/1 | Format-Table adviceId,status,linkedTaskId,sourceAlertId
```
See the dedicated guide (`alerts-advice-testing.md`) for deeper verification queries (SQL + troubleshooting).

### Recent Additions (Oct 2025)
- Simplified advice lifecycle (Removed Reject / Convert; added Dismiss terminal path)
- Provenance fields + idempotent acceptance backfill
- Health endpoint: `GET /health`
- Swagger UI (dev + optional prod via `Swagger:Always=true`): `/swagger`
- Custom endpoint listing: `GET /api/docs/endpoints`
- Build tooling: `build-all.bat`, `scripts/ci-build.ps1` (flags `-SkipFrontend`, `-SkipBackend`)
- Test integration + coverage collection (Cobertura)
- Frontend smoke script: `npm run smoke`
- Solution file `PFMP.sln`
- `BUILD.md` central build + script reference

## üöÄ Feature Snapshot (Current vs Rebuild)

### Currently Active (Verified 2025-09-27)
- .NET 9 backend: Users, Accounts, Goals, Income Sources, Alerts, Tasks, AI endpoints
- TSP allocation: Full 16-fund system with preset strategies
- Alerts backend lifecycle (Read / Dismissed / Active) + alert ‚Üí task linkage
- Task management backend + status transitions
- Auth: Custom `AuthProvider` + development bypass (MSAL wrapper removed; direct `@azure/msal-browser` retained)
- Leaf frontend components still present: `SmartInvestmentRecommendations`, `RealBankAccountDashboard`, `ProtectedDashboardSections`

### Missing During Rebuild (To Be Recreated)
- Protected routing guard & routed layout shell
- Onboarding wizard (`WelcomeOnboardingFlow`) + `UserSetupContext`
- Setup progress tracker & resumable onboarding state UI
- Market dashboards (`LiveMarketDashboard`, `MarketIntelligencePanel`)
- `FinancialIntelligenceCenter` aggregation hub UI
- Frontend `SmartAlertsSystem` (visual + interaction layer)
- Auth UI suite: AuthHeader, SignInPrompt, UserProfileCard, AuthDebugPanel
- Dual-AI consensus pipeline surface (advisor + validator)
- Developer diagnostics / debug panel

### Strategic Additions Planned
- Dual-AI advisor abstraction (Primary: GPT-X future | Validator: Claude Sonnet) with consensus & policy rule evaluation
- Formal Wave-based modular reconstruction for auditability & controlled scope
- Feature flags for cost-bearing AI calls & experimental intelligence modules

### Rebuild Guiding Principles
1. Preserve validated backend + leaf logic; rebuild orchestration only
2. Narrow-scoped waves with explicit acceptance criteria
3. Introduce dual-AI abstraction before scaling AI usage costs
4. Defer heavy performance work (beyond existing chunks) to final wave
5. Maintain dev auth bypass until onboarding wizard stabilizes

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Technology Stack (Practical Current State)
- **Frontend Runtime**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite (minimal shell while rebuilding)
- **UI Library**: MUI v7 (Grid v2 migration complete)
- **Backend**: .NET 9 Web API (stable multi-domain controllers)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 (Synology NAS) ‚Äì full schema intact
- **AI Architecture**: Prepared for Azure OpenAI + Anthropic; dual-AI validator pattern scheduled Wave 5
- **Infra Path**: Hybrid local dev ‚Üí Azure (unchanged strategic direction)
- **Build Perf**: Manual Rollup `manualChunks` + selective lazy boundaries

### Frontend Layout Standard: MUI Grid v2 ‚úÖ
We enforce a single, consistent layout system using the **stable MUI Grid v2 API**.

Rationale:
- Removes legacy Grid / `Grid2` ambiguity
- Stronger typing via `size` prop object form
- Cleaner responsive intent (`size={{ xs: 12, md: 6 }}` vs scattered `item xs={12} md={6}`)
- Prevents regression to deprecated `item` + breakpoint prop usage

Allowed Pattern (Grid v2):
```tsx
import { Grid } from '@mui/material'

<Grid container spacing={3}>
  <Grid size={{ xs: 12, md: 6 }}>
    <AccountSummary />
  </Grid>
  <Grid size={{ xs: 12, md: 6 }}>
    <PerformancePanel />
  </Grid>
</Grid>
```

Forbidden (will fail ESLint):
```tsx
<Grid container>
  <Grid item xs={12} md={6}> ... </Grid>
</Grid>

<Grid2 container> ... </Grid2>
```

Migration Notes:
- All existing components have been normalized (2025-09-28)
- Any new code must use `size` (number or object). Acceptable: `size={12}` or `size={{ xs: 12, sm: 6 }}`
- Do NOT mix legacy `item` API with `size` in the same file

Enforcement:
- Custom ESLint rule (`eslint-plugin-local-grid-rules` inline config) blocks `<Grid item ...>` and direct breakpoint props (`xs=`, `md=`, etc.) on `Grid`
- Build pipeline updated so `npm run build` fails on violation

Exception Process:
- NONE. If a limitation arises (e.g., third-party snippet), refactor or wrap with compliant component

Future Enhancements:
- Add codemod script if external contributions introduce legacy patterns
- Consider storybook examples enforcing standard in visual docs

Last Validated: 2025-09-28 (no legacy patterns present)

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- .NET 9 SDK
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 15
- Git

### PowerShell Development Guidelines
**Important**: When working with PowerShell, follow these guidelines to avoid terminal conflicts:

#### .NET Commands
- Always use fully qualified paths with `dotnet` commands in PowerShell
- Example: `dotnet run --project W:\pfmp\PFMP-API\PFMP-API.csproj --launch-profile http`

#### Running API Server in Isolated Terminal
To avoid terminal conflicts, start the API server in a separate PowerShell window:
```powershell
Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList "-NoExit", "-Command", "cd W:\pfmp\PFMP-API; dotnet run --launch-profile http" -WindowStyle Normal
```

**Important**: Before starting a new server instance:
- Manually close any existing PowerShell windows running the API server, OR
- Stop the process: `Get-Process -Name "PFMP-API" | Stop-Process -Force`

#### Running React Frontend in Isolated Terminal
```powershell
Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList "-NoExit", "-Command", "cd W:\pfmp\pfmp-frontend; npm run dev" -WindowStyle Normal
```

#### Service Management Best Practices
- Use isolated terminal windows to prevent targeting conflicts
- Always terminate existing services before starting new instances
- Monitor both frontend (port 3000) and API (port 5052) during development
- Use the batch file for reliable service startup
- **CRITICAL**: Restart backend service after any controller/model/DTO changes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Service Restart Requirements
The following changes require a **complete backend service restart** to take effect:
- Controller method signature changes
- New DTO classes or model classes
- Entity Framework model changes (adding `[JsonIgnore]`, navigation properties)
- Program.cs configuration changes
- New API endpoints or route changes

**Always restart services using your batch file when making these types of changes!**

### Development Workflow
1. **Before rebuilding**: Always stop running services to avoid file locks
2. **Process termination**: Either close terminal windows manually or use PowerShell to stop processes
3. **Build verification**: Run `dotnet build` to confirm no file locks before starting services
4. **Migration workflow**: Stop services ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Apply migrations ‚Üí Restart services

This command:
- Opens a new PowerShell window (`Start-Process powershell`)
- Keeps the window open after execution (`-NoExit`)
- Changes to the API directory and runs the server
- Uses normal window style for easy monitoring

### Backend Setup (.NET API)
```bash
cd PFMP-API
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run --launch-profile http
```
API will be available at: http://localhost:5052

### Database Setup
PostgreSQL database is running on Synology NAS:
- Host: 192.168.1.108:5433
- Database: pfmp_dev
- User: pfmp_user

### Frontend Setup (‚úÖ Complete)
```bash
cd pfmp-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
React development server runs on: http://localhost:3000  
API proxy configured for `/api` requests ‚Üí http://localhost:5052

### End-to-End Testing
The complete stack has been tested and verified:
- ‚úÖ Frontend (React) ‚Üî API (ASP.NET Core) ‚Üî Database (PostgreSQL)
- ‚úÖ User CRUD operations working through all layers
- ‚úÖ Proxy configuration routing requests correctly
- ‚úÖ Database migrations applied successfully
